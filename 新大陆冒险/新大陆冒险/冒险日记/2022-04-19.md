Need to review the knowledge. Learning is not based on quantity, but mainly on acquisition, which needs depth. And then go to eat lunch and take a break. Don't sleep too long. The maximum time is 90 minutes. And put your phone on the desk, don't put it on the bed. Get up to study front end knowledge, maybe you enjoy the moment that gets knowledge, but care about the speed.
