📊Can you describe the expected schedule for the day？
- Study English first, use LingQ and 9gag to learn English sentences. Focus on the sentences in the article and see how others write. And then relax for a while to get more energy. Read a book after relaxing. You can spend one hour reading. Eat lunch, take a nap. When I wake up, I need to calm myself, don't order drinks, play games or watch videos. Just start learning your front end knowledge. What you need is to finish the HTML part and CSS part. Don't let it last too long. Time is valuable. It's tiresome if the battle line lasts too long. In the evening, you can finish dinner at 19 o'clock. Time will run so fast, so you need to take care of the time. Use an hour to record, and then read a book, do the project or study English. Finally, it's important for me to sleep early, if you don't finish the thing that you are doing now. Halt, go to sleep! You can use the same time in the morning. To health, thin and mind.

📐What are your emotions in each study？
- Feel postive in English study, maybe it's because I just got up.
- Feel tired in reading.
- Feel calm in front end study.

💼What is the focus and effort on the outside world？
- Sport can let me thin and feel energy.
- Read helps me find a good way to treat my life.
- Front end study can raise my skill.

📖Which book are you reading recently?
《心流》

💡What are some good ideas from the book?
1. 感觉不加训练，就只能提供混乱的资讯。生涩的动作漫无目的而又笨拙，迟钝的眼睛只能看见丑陋无趣的景象，没有音乐感的耳朵听见的多半是刺耳的噪声，粗糙的舌头也只能辨识平凡的味道。如果任由身体感官萎缩，生活品质充其量只能勉强及格，有时甚至相当苦闷。但一个人一旦掌握了身体所能，学习为肉体感官建立秩序，精神熵的现象就会一扫而空，变为充满乐趣的和谐。
2. 不论多么简单的体能活动，只要能产生心流，就令人觉得乐趣无穷。基本步骤包括：（1）确立一个总目标，并尽可能包含多个实际可行的子目标；（2）找出评估目标进度的方法；（3）保持精神集中于所做的事情熵，并且对活动设计的挑战进行越来越精细的区分；（4）培养随机应变所需的技巧；（5）在活动变得令人厌倦时，随时提高挑战的难度。

🔭What kind of thinking does it bring?
It told me the important of sensation. But I hard to meditate, maybe cause by the anxity and tired. If someone feel tired, self-control would decrease a lot, and would be very depressed, so it was difficult to be conscious of feelings.
