📊Can you describe the expected schedule for the day？
- Study English first, use LingQ and 9gag to learn English sentences. Focus on the sentences in the article and see how others write. And then relax for a while to get more energy. Read a book after relaxing. You can spend one hour reading. Eat lunch, take a nap. When I wake up, I need to calm myself, don't order drinks, play games or watch videos. Just start learning your front end knowledge. What you need is to finish the HTML part and CSS part. Don't let it last too long. Time is valuable. It's tiresome if the battle line lasts too long. In the evening, you can finish dinner at 19 o'clock. Time will run so fast, so you need to take care of the time. Use an hour to record, and then read a book, do the project or study English. Finally, it's important for me to sleep early, if you don't finish the thing that you are doing now. Halt, go to sleep! You can use the same time in the morning. To health, thin and mind.
