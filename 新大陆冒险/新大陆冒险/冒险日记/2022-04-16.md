📊Can you describe the expected schedule for the day？
- Spend little time analysing the websites that I stored up yesterday. And then set up plans to study English. Maybe I will feel a little tired after watching the monitor for a long time. So you can mediate for a while to relax your eyes. The next thing is reading a book. Take notes while reading. A morning has passed, you can take a break after eating lunch. Do not play games and watch videos, don't go to other people's dormitories. Start to study interview knowledge when you get up. Take notes again and speed up please. In the evening, the order of doing things are eating dinner, sitting on the lawn, sporting and recording. You may go to bed at ten or eleven o'clock. And then read a book ready to sleep.

86.4RMB. Drink, meals and shopping online.

🚫What money is unnecessary?
Drink. Strawberry Tea.

💰What scenes and reasons drive you to spend money?
When I get up after a nap, I feel tired and thirsty, so I hope to drink something to cheer myself up. In order to avoid this situation again, I buy a lot of milk from online shopping.

📖Which book are you reading recently?
《心流》

💡What are some good ideas from the book?
生命中其实深埋着沮丧的种子。只要某种欲望一时得到满足，我们就立刻渴望得到更多。这种长期的贪得无厌，是追求知足常乐途中的另一重障碍。

🔭What kind of thinking does it bring?
As for me, I want to learn more, so I will continue to learn. But not to summarize what I have learned. This made me full of emptiness and anxiety.
