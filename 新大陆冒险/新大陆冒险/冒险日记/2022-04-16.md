📊Can you describe the expected schedule for the day？
- Spend little time analysing the websites that I stored up yesterday. And then set up plans to study English. Maybe I will feel a little tired after watching the monitor for a long time. So you can mediate for a while to relax your eyes. The next thing is reading a book. Take notes while reading. A morning has passed, you can take a break after eating lunch. Do not play games and watch videos, don't go to other people's dormitories. Start to study interview knowledge when you get up. Take notes again and speed up please. In the evening, the order of doing things are eating dinner, sitting on the lawn, sporting and recording. You may go to bed at ten or eleven o'clock. And then read a book ready to sleep.

💼What is the focus and effort on the outside world？
