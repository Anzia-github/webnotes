📊Can you describe the expected schedule for the day？
At first, study English with LingQ, learn how to write sentences and study grammar. And then read books, maybe I can finish a book today. After finishing, you need to review the books you read. Go to eat lunch and take a break at noon. When you get up, go to study front end knowledge. Don't think too much, just do what you want. Remeber that success is just a subsidiary of hard work, and don't take success as a goal to go further. After dinner, go to the sport. You need to make full use of the time before running. If you are listening to music, learn the words. If you read books, it will be very good. Take a shower after sporting and record after bathing. Talk less and do more.

📐What are your emotions in each study？
- Happy in English study.
- Happy in Reading.
- Active thinking in studying front end knowledge.

💼What is the focus and effort on the outside world？
- Front end study seems like being a habit of mine gradually. I like the feeling of acquiring knowledge.
- According to the "心流", I know the reason why I like watching videos. That is because there is no order in my mind. I can be attracted by stimulation easily. I need to control my attention.

📖Which book are you reading recently?
《心流》

💡What are some good ideas from the book?
- 缺少内化象征体系的人，很容易被宣传家操纵，被演艺人员安抚，被推销员蒙骗。我们会依赖电视、药物或政治、宗教的救赎，主要是因为我们自身没什么可以依仗的东西，内心无力抵抗那些自称握有解答者的谎言。不能为自己提供咨询的心灵，只能在混乱中随波逐流。

🔭What kind of thinking does it bring?
I find those powerful people really have their own life rules. They won't easily receive information through games or videos. It could prove that they had the ability to produce information.
