📊Can you describe the expected schedule for the day？
At first, study English with LingQ, learn how to write sentences and study grammar. And then read books, maybe I can finish a book today. After finishing, you need to review the books you read. Go to eat lunch and take a break at noon. When you get up, go to study front end knowledge. Don't think too much, just do what you want. Remeber that success is just a subsidiary of hard work, and don't take success as a goal to go further. After dinner, go to the sport. You need to make full use of the time before running. If you are listening to music, learn the words. If you read books, it will be very good. Take a shower after sporting and record after bathing. Talk less and do more.

📐What are your emotions in each study？


💼What is the focus and effort on the outside world？
